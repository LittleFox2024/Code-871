# Code-871
Creating the “System Call” shell as seen in Sword Art Online: Alicization.

# Usage
Type "System Call:" then ine of the following: generate, destroy, inspect, execute, or enhance armament.

# To Do
1. Main file:
  - Make it loop, so when one command completes it allow input of another command
2. Execute command:
  - Make sure this works right. I've got the code but haven't uploaded it yet.
  - Ensure its secure
3. Generate:
  - Figure out how to create a file like Linux "touch"
  - Maybe make some way to create some fun graphics to be like "generate luminous element"
4: Destroy:
  - Figure out how to delete a file. Maybe also use it like taskkill (or kill to Linux users).
5: Enhance Armament:
  - Figure out how to do elevation in Windows. I might use gsudo as a backend until I can get a better idea.
